Example of using Github Actions to do a few neat things from a devops & CI/CD perspective for a Unity project hosted in a Github repository.

This is mainly an educational example - the project, workflow & results are all visible.

# What can I learn about?

### Automated Unity Project Semantic Versioning

This is a process to update your project's version numbering on a variety of conditions while adhering to the general idea of [semantic version numbering](https://semver.org/). It updates version numbering based on a variety of criteria for different numbers:

* Commits tagged "MAJOR"
* Commits tagged "MINOR" or "TITLEUPDATE"
* Nightly (to catch all untagged commits and put them into a "PATCH" build)

### Automated Package Generation

Using a combination of scheduled & triggered workflows




# TODO

* Automated semantic versioning. Yeah, I know.
